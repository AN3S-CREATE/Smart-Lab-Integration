# Smart Lab Integration Monitor

Static HTML mock for the Smart Lab Integration Monitor showcase.

## Local development

Serve the site with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

## Notes

- The UI is a standalone `index.html` file.
- Any local screenshots or browser artifacts should be saved under `artifacts/`.
